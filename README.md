# Systemcheck

The app can execute Windows console commands (always as an administrator!).  
I use it to execute check/repair commands,  
so I don't have to remember this rarely used ones.  
  
Commands are read from the file "systemcheck.txt"  
and executed in a hidden console window.  
Click on an entry to execute the command.  

The result is displayed only after the command has finished (using the clipboard).  
Add the word "\[unhidden]" to the command to execute it in an unhidden console window.  
If the command requires a userinput (like "chkdsk ...") the "\[unhidden]" parameter is always required!  

  
#### App-start  
**systemcheck.exe** 64 bit Windows

**Be shure to use only one of the \*.exe at a time!**  
  
From time to time there are some false positive virus detections,  
especially if using only Windows Defender!
